# midiP
A JavaFX application for displaying scales and chords on a piano display		 A JavaFX MIDI multipurpose application with the following functionalities
- Displaying scales and common chords
- An 88 keys open keyboard for free play (no sound)

## How to run this application
I've only run this code on macOS using the IntelliJ IDE, but it shouldn't be largely different for windows.
Maven support was recently added to this project. As long as the IntelliJ Maven plugin is installed, the
project just need to be build and the application can be started by running the Main.java file.

## What's next?
I am currently working on refactoring the code and tightening up the functionalities.
